## Project overview

Your Flights is a Java desktop application for booking tickets for flights. 

The application allows users to register and log in as a Client or as an Airline. Authentication and authorization were built using *Spring Security*.

* User logged in as a **Client** can preview available flights, make reservations for the tickets and manage his bookings. 

* User logged in as an **Airline** can manage existing flights, create new flights, and manage customers' reservations on flights.
